      "Reference context:\n",
      "Document 73: For example, imagine a user prompts the model to write an essay on the effects of deforestation. The model might first generate facts like \"deforestation contributes to climate change\" and \"deforestation leads to loss of biodiversity.\" Then it would elaborate on the points in the essay.\n",

For instance, in writing scenarios, a writer could use a prompt-engineered model to help generate ideas for a story, such as listing possible characters, settings, and plot points.

Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on vast volumes of data and use billions of parameters to generate original output for tasks like answering questions, translating languages, and completing sentences. RAG extends the already powerful capabilities of LLMs to specific domains or an organization's internal knowledge base, all without the need to retrain the model. It is a cost-effective approach to improving LLM output so it remains relevant, accurate, and useful in various contexts.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhy is Retrieval-Augmented Generation important?\\n\\nLLMs are a key artificial intelligence (AI) technology powering intelligent chatbots and other natural language processing (NLP) applications. The goal is to create bots that can answer user questions in various contexts by cross-referencing authoritative knowledge sources. Unfortunately, the nature of LLM technology introduces unpredictability in LLM responses. Additionally, LLM training data is static and introduces a cut-off date on the knowledge it has.\\nKnown challenges of LLMs include:\"),\n",

Foundation models (FMs) are API-accessible LLMs trained on a broad spectrum of generalized and unlabeled data. The computational and financial costs of retraining FMs for organization or domain-specific information are high. RAG is a more cost-effective approach to introducing new data to the LLM. It makes generative artificial intelligence (generative AI) technology more broadly accessible and usable.\\nCurrent information\\nEven if the original training data sources for an LLM are suitable for your needs, it is challenging to maintain relevancy. RAG allows developers to provide the latest research, statistics, or news to the generative models. They can use RAG to connect the LLM directly to live social media feeds, news sites, or other frequently-updated information sources. The LLM can then provide the latest information to the users.\\nEnhanced user trust\"),\n",

The output can include citations or references to sources. Users can also look up source documents themselves if they require further clarification or more detail. This can increase trust and confidence in your generative AI solution.\\nMore developer control\\nWith RAG, developers can test and improve their chat applications more efficiently. They can control and change the LLM's information sources to adapt to changing requirements or cross-functional usage. Developers can also restrict sensitive information retrieval to different authorization levels and ensure the LLM generates appropriate responses. In addition, they can also troubleshoot and make fixes if the LLM references incorrect information sources for specific questions. Organizations can implement generative AI technology more confidently for a broader range of applications.\")]"

It originally launched in 2022. Besides images, you can also use the model to create videos and animations....\",\"Stable Diffusion is important because it\\\\u2019s accessible and easy to use. It can run on consumer-grade graphics cards. For the first time, anyone can download the model and generate their images. You also have control over key hyperparameters, such as the number of denoising steps and the degree of noise applied.\\\\u00a0\\\\nStable Diffusion is user-friendly, and you don&#x27;t need additional information to create images. It has an active community, so Stable Diffusion has ample documentation and how-to tutorials...\",\"As a diffusion model, Stable Diffusion differs from many other image generation models. In principle, diffusion models use Gaussian noise to encode an image. Then, they use a noise predictor together with a reverse diffusion process to recreate the image.\\\\nApart from having the technical differences of a diffusion model, Stable Diffusion is unique in that it doesn\\\\u2019t use the pixel space of the image. Instead, it uses a reduced-definition latent space.\\\\u00a0\\\\u00a0\\\\nThe reason for this is that a color image wi...\",\"Stable Diffusion V1 was trained using three datasets collected by LAION through the Common Crawl. This includes the LAION-Aesthetics v2.6 dataset of images with an aesthetic rating of 6 or higher.\",\"What architecture does Stable Diffusion use?\",\"The main architectural components of Stable Diffusion include a variational autoencoder, forward and reverse diffusion, a noise predictor, and text conditioning.\\\\nVariational autoencoder\\\\nThe variational autoencoder consists of a separate encoder and decoder. The encoder compresses the 512x512 pixel image into a smaller 64x64 model in latent space that&#x27;s easier to manipulate. The decoder restores the model from latent space into a full-size 512x512 pixel image.\\\\nForward diffusion\\\\nForward diffusion ...\",\"This process is essentially a parameterized process that iteratively undoes the forward diffusion. For example, you could train the model with only two images, like a cat and a dog. If you did, the reverse process would drift towards either a cat or dog and nothing in between. In practice, model training involves billions of images and uses prompts to create unique images.\\\\nNoise predictor (U-Net)\\\\nA noise predictor is key for denoising images. Stable Diffusion uses a U-Net model to perform this. ...\",\"The most common form of conditioning is text prompts. A CLIP tokenizer analyzes each word in a textual prompt and embeds this data into a 768-value vector. You can use up to 75 tokens in a prompt. Stable Diffusion feeds these prompts from the text encoder to the U-Net noise predictor using a text transformer. By setting the seed to a random number generator, you can generate different images in the latent space.\",\"What can Stable Diffusion do?\",\"Stable Diffusion represents a notable improvement in text-to-image model generation. It\\\\u2019s broadly available and needs significantly less processing power than many other text-to-image models. Its capabilities include text-to-image, image-to-image, graphic artwork, image editing, and video creation.\\\\nText-to-image generation\\\\nThis is the most common way people use Stable Diffusion. Stable Diffusion generates an image using a textual prompt. You can create different images by adjusting the seed numb...\",\"You can use Stable Diffusion to edit and retouch photos. Using AI Editor, load an image and use an eraser brush to mask the area you want to edit. Then, by generating a prompt defining what you want to achieve, edit or inpaint the picture. For example, you can repair old photos, remove objects from pictures, change subject features, and add new elements to the picture.\\\\nVideo creation\\\\nUsing features such as Deforum from GitHub, it\\\\u2019s possible for you to create short video clips and animations with...\",\"How can AWS help with Stable Diffusion?\\\\n\\\\nAmazon Bedrock is the easiest way to build and scale generative AI applications with foundation models.

Foundation models (FMs) are API-accessible LLMs trained on a broad spectrum of generalized and unlabeled data.

It makes generative artif...\",\"RAG allows the LLM to present accurate information with source attribution. The output can include citations or references to sources. Users can also look up source documents themselves if they require further clarification or more detail. This can increase trust and confidence in your generative AI solution.\\\\nMore developer control\\\\nWith RAG, developers can test and improve their chat applications more efficiently.

With RAG, an information retrieval component is introduced that utilizes the user input to first pull information from a new data source. The user query and the relevant information are both given to the LLM. The LLM uses the new knowledge and its training data to create better responses. The following sections provide an overview of the process.\\\\nCreate external data\\\\n...\",\"The next step is to perform a relevancy search. The user query is converted to a vector representation and matched with the vector databases. For example, consider a smart chatbot that can answer human resource questions for an organization. If an employee searches, \\\\\"How much annual leave do I have?\\\\\" the system will retrieve annual leave policy documents alongside the individual employee&#x27;s past leave record. These specific documents will be returned because they are highly-relevant to what the e...\",\"The next question may be\\\\u2014what if the external data becomes stale? To maintain current information for retrieval, asynchronously update the documents and update embedding representation of the documents. You can do this through automated real-time processes or periodic batch processing. This is a common challenge in data analytics\\\\u2014different data-science approaches to change management can be used.\\\\nThe following diagram shows the conceptual flow of using RAG with LLMs.\",\"What is the difference between Retrieval-Augmented Generation and semantic search?\\\\n\\\\nSemantic search enhances RAG results for organizations wanting to add vast external knowledge sources to their LLM applications. Modern enterprises store vast amounts of information like manuals, FAQs, research reports, customer service guides, and human resource document repositories across various systems.

It originally launched in 2022. Besides images, you can also use the model to create videos and animations....\",\"Stable Diffusion is important because it\\\\u2019s accessible and easy to use. It can run on consumer-grade graphics cards. For the first time, anyone can download the model and generate their images. You also have control over key hyperparameters, such as the number of denoising steps and the degree of noise applied.\\\\u00a0\\\\nStable Diffusion is user-friendly, and you don&#x27;t need additional information to create images. It has an active community, so Stable Diffusion has ample documentation and how-to tutorials...\",\"As a diffusion model, Stable Diffusion differs from many other image generation models. In principle, diffusion models use Gaussian noise to encode an image. Then, they use a noise predictor together with a reverse diffusion process to recreate the image.\\\\nApart from having the technical differences of a diffusion model, Stable Diffusion is unique in that it doesn\\\\u2019t use the pixel space of the image. Instead, it uses a reduced-definition latent space.\\\\u00a0\\\\u00a0\\\\nThe reason for this is that a color image wi...\",\"Stable Diffusion V1 was trained using three datasets collected by LAION through the Common Crawl. This includes the LAION-Aesthetics v2.6 dataset of images with an aesthetic rating of 6 or higher.\",\"What architecture does Stable Diffusion use?\",\"The main architectural components of Stable Diffusion include a variational autoencoder, forward and reverse diffusion, a noise predictor, and text conditioning.\\\\nVariational autoencoder\\\\nThe variational autoencoder consists of a separate encoder and decoder. The encoder compresses the 512x512 pixel image into a smaller 64x64 model in latent space that&#x27;s easier to manipulate. The decoder restores the model from latent space into a full-size 512x512 pixel image.\\\\nForward diffusion\\\\nForward diffusion ...\",\"This process is essentially a parameterized process that iteratively undoes the forward diffusion. For example, you could train the model with only two images, like a cat and a dog. If you did, the reverse process would drift towards either a cat or dog and nothing in between. In practice, model training involves billions of images and uses prompts to create unique images.\\\\nNoise predictor (U-Net)\\\\nA noise predictor is key for denoising images. Stable Diffusion uses a U-Net model to perform this. ...\",\"The most common form of conditioning is text prompts. A CLIP tokenizer analyzes each word in a textual prompt and embeds this data into a 768-value vector. You can use up to 75 tokens in a prompt. Stable Diffusion feeds these prompts from the text encoder to the U-Net noise predictor using a text transformer. By setting the seed to a random number generator, you can generate different images in the latent space.\",\"What can Stable Diffusion do?\",\"Stable Diffusion represents a notable improvement in text-to-image model generation. It\\\\u2019s broadly available and needs significantly less processing power than many other text-to-image models. Its capabilities include text-to-image, image-to-image, graphic artwork, image editing, and video creation.\\\\nText-to-image generation\\\\nThis is the most common way people use Stable Diffusion. Stable Diffusion generates an image using a textual prompt. You can create different images by adjusting the seed numb...\",\"You can use Stable Diffusion to edit and retouch photos. Using AI Editor, load an image and use an eraser brush to mask the area you want to edit. Then, by generating a prompt defining what you want to achieve, edit or inpaint the picture. For example, you can repair old photos, remove objects from pictures, change subject features, and add new elements to the picture.\\\\nVideo creation\\\\nUsing features such as Deforum from GitHub, it\\\\u2019s possible for you to create short video clips and animations with...\",\"How can AWS help with Stable Diffusion?\\\\n\\\\nAmazon Bedrock is the easiest way to build and scale generative AI applications with foundation models. Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed service that makes leading foundation models including Stable Diffusion available through an API, so you can choose from various FMs to find the model that&#x27;s best suited for your use case.\\\\u00a0With Bedrock, you can speed up developing and deploying scalable, reliable, and secure generative AI applications without managing i...\",\"Sign up for a free account \\\\n         \\\\n\\\\nInstant get access to the AWS Free Tier.\\\\n\\\\n Sign up\\\\u00a0\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n           Start building in the console \\\\n         \\\\n\\\\nGet started building in the AWS management console.\\\\n\\\\n Sign in\\\\u00a0\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n  Sign In to the Console \\\\n\\\\n Learn About AWS\\\\n\\\\nWhat Is AWS?\\\\nWhat Is Cloud Computing?\\\\nAWS Accessibility\\\\nAWS Inclusion, Diversity &amp; Equity\\\\nWhat Is DevOps?\\\\nWhat Is a Container?\\\\nWhat Is a Data Lake?\\\\nWhat is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?\\\\nWhat is Generative AI?\\\\nWhat is Machine Lea...\",\"Developer Center\\\\nSDKs &amp; Tools\\\\n.NET on AWS\\\\nPython on AWS\\\\nJava on AWS\\\\nPHP on AWS\\\\nJavaScript on AWS\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n Help\\\\n\\\\nContact Us\\\\nGet Expert Help\\\\nFile a Support Ticket\\\\nAWS re:Post\\\\nKnowledge Center\\\\nAWS Support Overview\\\\nLegal\\\\nAWS Careers\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n  Create an AWS Account \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n         Amazon is an Equal Opportunity Employer: \\\\n         Minority / Women / Disability / Veteran / Gender Identity / Sexual Orientation / Age.\",\"Language\\\\n\\\\u0639\\\\u0631\\\\u0628\\\\u064a\\\\nBahasa Indonesia\\\\nDeutsch\\\\nEnglish\\\\nEspa\\\\u00f1ol\\\\nFran\\\\u00e7ais\\\\nItaliano\\\\nPortugu\\\\u00eas\\\\nTi\\\\u1ebfng Vi\\\\u1ec7t\\\\nT\\\\u00fcrk\\\\u00e7e\\\\n\\\\u03a1\\\\u0443\\\\u0441\\\\u0441\\\\u043a\\\\u0438\\\\u0439\\\\n\\\\u0e44\\\\u0e17\\\\u0e22\\\\n\\\\u65e5\\\\u672c\\\\u8a9e\\\\n\\\\ud55c\\\\uad6d\\\\uc5b4\\\\n\\\\u4e2d\\\\u6587 (\\\\u7b80\\\\u4f53)\\\\n\\\\u4e2d\\\\u6587 (\\\\u7e41\\\\u9ad4)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPrivacy\\\\n|\\\\nAccessibility\\\\n|\\\\nSite Terms\\\\n|\\\\n Cookie Preferences \\\\n|\\\\n\\\\u00a9 2024, Amazon Web Services, Inc. or its affiliates.
