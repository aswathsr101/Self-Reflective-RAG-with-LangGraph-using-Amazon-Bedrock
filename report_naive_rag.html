It originally launched in 2022. Besides images, you can also use the model to create videos and animations....","Stable Diffusion is important because it\\u2019s accessible and easy to use. It can run on consumer-grade graphics cards. For the first time, anyone can download the model and generate their images. You also have control over key hyperparameters, such as the number of denoising steps and the degree of noise applied.\\u00a0\\nStable Diffusion is user-friendly, and you don&#x27;t need additional information to create images. It has an active community, so Stable Diffusion has ample documentation and how-to tutorials...","As a diffusion model, Stable Diffusion differs from many other image generation models. In principle, diffusion models use Gaussian noise to encode an image. Then, they use a noise predictor together with a reverse diffusion process to recreate the image.\\nApart from having the technical differences of a diffusion model, Stable Diffusion is unique in that it doesn\\u2019t use the pixel space of the image. Instead, it uses a reduced-definition latent space.\\u00a0\\u00a0\\nThe reason for this is that a color image wi...","Stable Diffusion V1 was trained using three datasets collected by LAION through the Common Crawl. This includes the LAION-Aesthetics v2.6 dataset of images with an aesthetic rating of 6 or higher.","What architecture does Stable Diffusion use?","The main architectural components of Stable Diffusion include a variational autoencoder, forward and reverse diffusion, a noise predictor, and text conditioning.\\nVariational autoencoder\\nThe variational autoencoder consists of a separate encoder and decoder. The encoder compresses the 512x512 pixel image into a smaller 64x64 model in latent space that&#x27;s easier to manipulate. The decoder restores the model from latent space into a full-size 512x512 pixel image.\\nForward diffusion\\nForward diffusion ...","This process is essentially a parameterized process that iteratively undoes the forward diffusion. For example, you could train the model with only two images, like a cat and a dog. If you did, the reverse process would drift towards either a cat or dog and nothing in between. In practice, model training involves billions of images and uses prompts to create unique images.\\nNoise predictor (U-Net)\\nA noise predictor is key for denoising images. Stable Diffusion uses a U-Net model to perform this. ...","The most common form of conditioning is text prompts. A CLIP tokenizer analyzes each word in a textual prompt and embeds this data into a 768-value vector. You can use up to 75 tokens in a prompt. Stable Diffusion feeds these prompts from the text encoder to the U-Net noise predictor using a text transformer. By setting the seed to a random number generator, you can generate different images in the latent space.","What can Stable Diffusion do?","Stable Diffusion represents a notable improvement in text-to-image model generation. It\\u2019s broadly available and needs significantly less processing power than many other text-to-image models. Its capabilities include text-to-image, image-to-image, graphic artwork, image editing, and video creation.\\nText-to-image generation\\nThis is the most common way people use Stable Diffusion. Stable Diffusion generates an image using a textual prompt. You can create different images by adjusting the seed numb...","You can use Stable Diffusion to edit and retouch photos.
