are a key artificial intelligence (AI) technology powering intelligent chatbots and other natural language processing (NLP) applications. The goal is to create bots that can answer user questions in various contexts by cross-referencing authoritative knowledge sources. Unfortunately, the nature of LLM technology introduces unpredictability in LLM responses. Additionally, LLM training data is static and introduces a cut-off date on the knowledge it has.\\nKnown challenges of LLMs include:\\n\\nPre...","You can think of the Large Language Model as an over-enthusiastic new employee who refuses to stay informed with current events but will always answer every question with absolute confidence. Unfortunately, such an attitude can negatively impact user trust and is not something you want your chatbots to emulate!\\nRAG is one approach to solving some of these challenges. It redirects the LLM to retrieve relevant information from authoritative, pre-determined knowledge sources. Organizations have gre...","RAG technology brings several benefits to an organization&#x27;s generative AI efforts.\\nCost-effective implementation\\nChatbot development typically begins using a foundation model. Foundation models (FMs) are API-accessible LLMs trained on a broad spectrum of generalized and unlabeled data. The computational and financial costs of retraining FMs for organization or domain-specific information are high. RAG is a more cost-effective approach to introducing new data to the LLM. It makes generative artif...","RAG allows the LLM to present accurate information with source attribution. The output can include citations or references to sources. Users can also look up source documents themselves if they require further clarification or more detail. This can increase trust and confidence in your generative AI solution.\\nMore developer control\\nWith RAG, developers can test and improve their chat applications more efficiently. They can control and change the LLM&#x27;s information sources to adapt to changing req...","How does Retrieval-Augmented Generation work?","Without RAG, the LLM takes the user input and creates a response based on information it was trained on\\u2014or what it already knows. With RAG, an information retrieval component is introduced that utilizes the user input to first pull information from a new data source. The user query and the relevant information are both given to the LLM. The LLM uses the new knowledge and its training data to create better responses. The following sections provide an overview of the process.\\nCreate external data\\n...","The next step is to perform a relevancy search. The user query is converted to a vector representation and matched with the vector databases. For example, consider a smart chatbot that can answer human resource questions for an organization. If an employee searches, \\"How much annual leave do I have?\\" the system will retrieve annual leave policy documents alongside the individual employee&#x27;s past leave record. These specific documents will be returned because they are highly-relevant to what the e...","The next question may be\\u2014what if the external data becomes stale? To maintain current information for retrieval, asynchronously update the documents and update embedding representation of the documents. You can do this through automated real-time processes or periodic batch processing. This is a common challenge in data analytics\\u2014different data-science approaches to change management can be used.\\nThe following diagram shows the conceptual flow of using RAG with LLMs.","What is the difference between Retrieval-Augmented Generation and semantic search?\\n\\nSemantic search enhances RAG results for organizations wanting to add vast external knowledge sources to their LLM applications. Modern enterprises store vast amounts of information like manuals, FAQs, research reports, customer service guides, and human resource document repositories across various systems. Context retrieval is challenging at scale and consequently lowers generative output quality.\\nSemantic sear...","How can AWS support your\\u00a0Retrieval-Augmented Generation requirements?\\n\\nAmazon Bedrock is a fully-managed service that offers a choice of high-performing foundation models\\u2014along with a broad set of capabilities\\u2014to build generative AI applications while simplifying development and maintaining privacy and security.

It originally launched in 2022. Besides images, you can also use the model to create videos and animations. The model is based on diffusion technology and uses latent space. This significantly reduces processing requirements, and you can run the model on desktops or laptops equipped with GPUs. Stable Diffusion can be fine-tuned to meet your specif...","Stable Diffusion is important because it\\u2019s accessible and easy to use. It can run on consumer-grade graphics cards. For the first time, anyone can download the model and generate their images. You also have control over key hyperparameters, such as the number of denoising steps and the degree of noise applied.\\u00a0\\nStable Diffusion is user-friendly, and you don&#x27;t need additional information to create images. It has an active community, so Stable Diffusion has ample documentation and how-to tutorials...","As a diffusion model, Stable Diffusion differs from many other image generation models. In principle, diffusion models use Gaussian noise to encode an image. Then, they use a noise predictor together with a reverse diffusion process to recreate the image.\\nApart from having the technical differences of a diffusion model, Stable Diffusion is unique in that it doesn\\u2019t use the pixel space of the image. Instead, it uses a reduced-definition latent space.\\u00a0\\u00a0\\nThe reason for this is that a color image wi...","Stable Diffusion V1 was trained using three datasets collected by LAION through the Common Crawl. This includes the LAION-Aesthetics v2.6 dataset of images with an aesthetic rating of 6 or higher.","What architecture does Stable Diffusion use?","The main architectural components of Stable Diffusion include a variational autoencoder, forward and reverse diffusion, a noise predictor, and text conditioning.\\nVariational autoencoder\\nThe variational autoencoder consists of a separate encoder and decoder. The encoder compresses the 512x512 pixel image into a smaller 64x64 model in latent space that&#x27;s easier to manipulate. The decoder restores the model from latent space into a full-size 512x512 pixel image.\\nForward diffusion\\nForward diffusion ...","This process is essentially a parameterized process that iteratively undoes the forward diffusion. For example, you could train the model with only two images, like a cat and a dog. If you did, the reverse process would drift towards either a cat or dog and nothing in between. In practice, model training involves billions of images and uses prompts to create unique images.\\nNoise predictor (U-Net)\\nA noise predictor is key for denoising images. Stable Diffusion uses a U-Net model to perform this. ...","The most common form of conditioning is text prompts. A CLIP tokenizer analyzes each word in a textual prompt and embeds this data into a 768-value vector. You can use up to 75 tokens in a prompt. Stable Diffusion feeds these prompts from the text encoder to the U-Net noise predictor using a text transformer. By setting the seed to a random number generator, you can generate different images in the latent space.","What can Stable Diffusion do?","Stable Diffusion represents a notable improvement in text-to-image model generation. It\\u2019s broadly available and needs significantly less processing power than many other text-to-image models. Its capabilities include text-to-image, image-to-image, graphic artwork, image editing, and video creation.\\nText-to-image generation\\nThis is the most common way people use Stable Diffusion. Stable Diffusion generates an image using a textual prompt. You can create different images by adjusting the seed numb...","You can use Stable Diffusion to edit and retouch photos.
